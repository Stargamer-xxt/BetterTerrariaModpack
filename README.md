Thanks for reading this and taking a look at our modpack. My friend ooguillotine and I are likely going to be developing this for a little while, so feel free to stick around and watch this modpack evolve. This modpack combines Calamity and Fargo's Souls, along with numerous other small mods to enhance the experience, such as Terraria Overhaul. The goal of this modpack is to bridge the gap between two of the aforementioned mods, Calamity and Fargo's Souls using tPackBuilder. However, let me get to the point; we need help developing this. On the page, we want you to help us debug by reporting bugs or unusual behaviors, also giving feedback on our project to help us improve on Better Terraria.

The link to the tPackBuilder Git page is here if you want to learn how to use it: https://github.com/bereft-souls/tPackBuilder

Before downloading the modpack you have to have the full mod list pre-downloaded so it works. You can download the steam collection for the mods here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3590017509

Also, the most recent version of the full modpack can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wxty9-xvCaN9ctjStCtIwfLUH3w3cXYf?usp=drive_link
