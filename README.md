Hey, thanks for downloading this. If you did, of course. My friend Stargamer and I are gonna likely be developing this for a little bit, and if you're reading this, thank you. But let me get to the point - 
Helping us with said development. So to put this even more simply, on the page, we want to help us debug by reporting bugs, also giving feedback to our project to help us improve on this and others in the future. 
However, for more information, this modpack is a combination of Calamity and Fargo's Souls, as well as many other small mods to enhance the experience. I hope that works out for you. But yeah, 
To summarize, we want your help to make this experience better, and we want you to enjoy playing this modpack.

Also, the full modpack can be downloaded here (copy the link): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wxty9-xvCaN9ctjStCtIwfLUH3w3cXYf?usp=drive_link

Sincerely, BT Devs
