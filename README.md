Thanks for reading this and taking a look at our modpack. My friend Ooguillotine and I are likely going to be developing this for a little while, so feel free to stick around and watch this modpack evolve. This modpack combines Calamity and Fargo's Souls, along with numerous other small mods to enhance the experience, such as Terraria Overhaul. The goal of this modpack is to bridge the gap between the two aforementioned mods, Calamity and Fargo's Souls using tPackBuilder. However, let me get to the point; we need help developing this. On the page, we want you to help us debug by reporting bugs between the mods of this pack, also giving feedback to our project to help us improve on Better Terraria.
